### How to Install

Note: This plugin requires [TerrariaAPI-Server](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TerrariaAPI-Server) and [TShock](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock) in order to work. You can't use this with a vanilla Terraria server.

Grab the latest release and put the _.dll_ files into your server's _ServerPlugins_ directory. Also put the contents of the _tshock/_ folder into your server's _tshock_ folder. You may change the configuration options to your needs by editing the _tshock/Advanced Circuits/Config.xml_ file.
